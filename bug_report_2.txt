This is my second bug report
Title: "Incorrect Course status change"
Description: the course status is changed to "completed" without meeting all complation criteria
Steps:
1. Login as User Learner with the access to the Course in not started status
2. Open the Course tile
3. Stay on the course page for 5 seconds, but do not complete the required quiz

Expected result: the status of the course is Started
Actual result: the status of the course is Completed
